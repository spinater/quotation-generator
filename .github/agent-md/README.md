# Agent-Generated Documentation Index

This directory contains markdown documentation generated by AI agents during development, research, and analysis phases of the Thai Quotation & Receipt Generator project.

## Purpose

Agent-generated documentation serves as a **knowledge base** for:
- Technical analysis and research findings
- API specifications and endpoint documentation
- Architecture decisions and design rationale
- Code reviews and refactoring plans
- Testing strategies and implementation guides
- Investigation results and problem-solving documentation

## Naming Convention

All files follow this strict naming pattern:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss-descriptive-name.md
```

**Example**: `2025-01-18-143022-invoice-pdf-styling-and-calculations.md`

## Directory Structure

```
.github/agent-md/
├── README.md                    # This file - index of all documents
├── archive/                     # Archived documents (6+ months old)
└── [timestamped documents]      # Active agent-generated documentation
```

| Time | Document | Purpose |

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Create Agent-Generated Docs

✅ **DO create** agent docs for:
- API endpoint analysis and specifications
- Database schema changes and migrations
- Architecture decisions requiring documentation
- Technical research (libraries, frameworks, patterns)
- Performance optimization investigations
- Security analysis and recommendations
- Code refactoring plans
- Complex feature implementation guides

❌ **DON'T create** agent docs for:
- Simple bug fixes (use commit messages)
- Routine updates (use git history)
- Work-in-progress notes (use task files in `.github/tasks/`)
- Temporary debugging logs

### Relationship with Task Files

```
Agent-Generated Docs (.github/agent-md/)
    ↓ provides research & specifications
Task Files (.github/tasks/)
    ↓ tracks implementation progress
Completed Feature/Fix
```

**Example workflow**:
1. Agent analyzes invoice PDF generation → creates `2025-01-18-143022-invoice-pdf-analysis.md`
2. Based on analysis, create task file → `.github/tasks/task-2025-01-18-implement-pdf-signature.md`
3. Task file references agent doc for technical details
4. Complete task, mark as done
5. Agent doc remains as historical reference

## Maintenance

### Archiving Policy

- Documents older than **6 months** should be moved to `archive/` subdirectory
- Keep the most recent and frequently referenced docs in the main directory
- Update this README when archiving documents

### Index Updates

- Add new documents to the "Current Documents" table upon creation
- Include timestamp, filename, and brief purpose
- Organize by date (newest first within each date section)
- Remove entries when archiving (keep archive summary)

## Quick Reference

- **Location**: `.github/agent-md/`
- **Naming**: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss-description.md`
- **Archive**: Move to `archive/` after 6 months
- **Related**: See `.github/tasks/` for implementation tracking
