# Cleanup Complete! 🎉

## Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Action**: Removed critical warnings for Zed editor  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

## What Was Removed

The following critical warnings have been removed from all documentation files since Zed handles these cases better than VSCode:

### 1. ❌ Removed: "NEVER use `cat` command"
- This warning was specific to VSCode/terminal issues
- Zed handles file operations more gracefully
- No longer needed in documentation

### 2. ❌ Removed: "ALWAYS use `isBackground: true` for npm run dev"
- This was a VSCode terminal blocking issue
- Zed manages background processes better
- No longer a critical requirement

## What Remains

The documentation now focuses on:

### ✅ Kept: Important Development Guidelines
1. **Sequential thinking** for complex tasks
2. **Task management** - updating task files
3. **Memory documentation** - documenting learnings

5. **Development workflow** - proper patterns and practices

### ✅ Kept: Practical Information
